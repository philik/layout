The Ultimate Page Layout Manager
--------------------------------

This widget was inspired by the extJS border-layout, and recreates that functionality in a jQuery plug-in. 
The Layout plug-in can create _any_ UI look you want - from simple headers or sidebars, 
to a complex application with toolbars, menus, help-panels, status bars, sub-forms, etc.

Combined it with other jQuery UI widgets to create a sophisticated application. 
There are no limitations or issues - this widget is ready for production use. 
If you create a good looking application using UI Layout, please let us know.

### History & Future

UI Layout was created 8 years ago as an enhancement to the borderLayout widget.
Sourcecode was transferred to GitHub, which also allowed it to be _re-registered_ on the jQuery plugins site.
You can find Layout on the jQuery site at: http://plugins.jquery.com/layout 

Documentation and other information is being updated for the latest version and will be migrated to GitHub. 
In the meantime you can find information and demos on the widget's old website and in its forum...

- Website: http://layout.jquery-dev.com
- Support: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jquery-ui-layout

More information will be added here soon. This is just to get the migration process started...
